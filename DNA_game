3 is the the guaranteed number of nucleotides removed per turn. 
If player1 removes one nucleotide, players2 can remove two nucleotides but never three. 
So we exclude 4.

Starting from this, let's divede each nucleotide sequence (A or T or C or G) by three and obtaining the remainder of each one.
The position of each remainder is highly taken into consideration, where each remainder is dependent from one another and 
if one ramainder is summed up with another one or delocated, this will affect the winning startegy for the reasons explained below. 

Three winning permutations have been found. 
How?
Starting from a sequence with remainders 1 1 1 1, players 1 will always lose no matter the moves of player2 are.
That's the same for length of a sequence of n: 1, 4 or 10 or whatever number with remainder 1.
In 1-1-1-1 wheather player 1 removes one or two nucleotides, 
that's enough for player2 to remove one or two nucleotides accordingly and leave player1 
with only one type of nucleotide.

Same reasoning for a sequence with remainders 0-0-0-0 and 2-2-1 where players2 will win over player1.

In order to win one mustn't find himself under those permutation as a player2.
